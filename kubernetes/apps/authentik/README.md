# [Authentik](https://docs.goauthentik.io/)

Authentik is a self-hosted identity provider, I use it to enable SSO for all apps that support it. Over at the Authentik [Integrations](https://docs.goauthentik.io/integrations/) docs you'll find a list of some of the applications that can be configured with Authentik and how to set it up.

Deployed from official [helm chart](https://github.com/goauthentik/helm), see [values](./manifests/values.yaml) for config.
